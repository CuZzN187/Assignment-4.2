fInsertToDatabase takes 3 args. $asin, $title, and $price but this was initially set up for dvdtitles tables. There is an if-
statement that determines if the $asin args has been passed in or if it's a false boolean. False boolean defaults to the dvdActors
table for inserts.

fDeleteFromDatabase takes 2 args $table and $asin. There is an if statement that detemines which table it is going to delete from.
Then, there delete statement is carried out by finding which record has the matching $asin. If the table does not have an $asin,
then it looks it up by lname (for dvdActors table).

fListFromDatabase takes only one arg. $table. There is an if statement that detemines which table to show. Dvdtitles grabs the $asin
and uses it to produce a picture of the dvd. DvdActors grabs the actorID, first and last name of the actor.
